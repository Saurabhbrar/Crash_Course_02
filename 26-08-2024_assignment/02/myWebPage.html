        <p>Hi, I'm Saurabh Brar, a dedicated software developer and web enthusiast with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            <br>I have a passion for crafting dynamic and responsive websites that deliver excellent user experiences. Currently, I am exploring 
             opportunities for internships <br> to gain hands-on experience and contribute to innovative projects. I love solving complex problems,
              learning new technologies, and <br> collaborating with like-minded professionals.<br> My portfolio showcases projects like 'FoodFly,' 
              'Big Basket Clone,' and 'Masai Employee Records.' I am eager to continue growing in the field and making a meaningful impact 
              through my skills and creativity.</p>
