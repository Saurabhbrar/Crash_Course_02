    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The <mark>periodic</mark> table periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <var>chemical equations </var>. Here's an example of a <var>chemical reaction </var>: <br>
        2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> â†’ 2H<sub>2</sub>O <br>
    This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>
        <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
        <p><b>Stoichiometry</b> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved. <br>
            <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, ile <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
